                            ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Peyton Touma, a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Los Angeles with roots in Olney, Maryland. Iâ€™m currently on the lookout for new opportunities, but in the meantime, Iâ€™m working part-time at Code Ninjas as a Code Instructor.

                            I recently completed the UCLA Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I gained expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React for dynamic and engaging web interfaces. My backend skills include Node.js, Express.js, Python, and Flask, and Iâ€™m adept at managing databases with MySQL, SQLAlchemy, MongoDB, Sequelize, and Mongoose.

                            My background in graphic design is well-supported by tools such as Blender, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D. Iâ€™m also skilled in front-end frameworks like Tailwind, Bootstrap, and Bulma, and I use Webpack for optimized asset bundling. Additionally, I work with the Stripe API for e-commerce solutions and rely on GitHub for version control and efficient code management.

                            At Code Ninjas, I teach students HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, covering both foundational and advanced topics. I also lead a 3D design course using Cinema 4D and Blender, mentoring students through the creation of detailed 3D models and helping them develop their projects.

                            If youâ€™re looking for a dedicated and versatile web developer with a passion for teaching and a solid technical background, Iâ€™d love to connect!
